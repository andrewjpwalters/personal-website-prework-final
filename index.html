            <p>The house didn't exist. Where the silhouette stood, ominous and towering, there was only an empty lot. He
                knew because he passed that empty lot on his way to work every day. It wasn't real, he told himself.

                been
                digging away at something in the dark. </p>

            <p>At night she could hear the vines growing, encircling the house, choking the windows and gutters. They
                bore no leaves.</p>
