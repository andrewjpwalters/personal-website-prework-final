                <p>The house didn't exist. Where the silhouette stood, ominous and towering, there was only an empty
                    lot. He
                    knew because he passed that empty lot on his way to work every day. It wasn't real, he told himself.

                    saw the nails. The night before they had been smooth and immaculate. Now they were chipped. Like it
                    had
                    been
                    digging away at something in the dark. </p>

                    bore no leaves.</p>
